Hi! My name is Sergey Burtsev and I'm a Ruby on Rails developer.

I am having fun learning the world of Ruby and the most exciting part of itâ€”the amazing people who worked with Ruby from the early 2000-s and later till current days. Ruby as interpreted language is not the most efficient in technical terms, but at the same time and in the amazing way, Ruby though its history attracted so many great minds in its camp, that I can't stop finding, watching and learning from them: about Ruby, about OOP, about tech and even the way of thinking.   

My editor of choice is the trusty [TextMate](https://macromates.com). I've tried many others, but always come back to it.

I want to thank Ruby and all open-source community, which brings so much fun and joy into programming.
